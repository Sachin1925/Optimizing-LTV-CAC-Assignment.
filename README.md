2. CRM Configuration Blueprint:- This step is so challenging but i did it(Automation)
Approach:-(1)Firstly here i created a table in the Notion. 
(2)then created a google form with the same value as the column name of the notion .
(3)after that i  connected google form with the google sheet with the help of pabbly .
(4) after that i connected the notion with google sheet.

Conclusion:- in the end if a user can submit google form then all the information of google form will transfer in the google sheet automatically and same google sheet data copy in the notion and all funnel stages will automatically change with AI.

About AI Usage-
 
I used ChatGPT for the second part of this assignment (  Nurturing Mechanism Design).CHATGPT had given some idea how to toggle this problem and with help of chatGpt I made some drafting emails for different-different situations.

Here is the prompt :- Write sample nurturing email and WhatsApp follow-up templates for leads at different stages (High Intent, Low Intent, Mid Intent). Keep them professional and concise.

I used Notion AI for automatic update if a lead comes then its show in stage new and in the funnel stage will be lead. If user More interest then Notion AI automatically change stage (new-demo-contacted-Negotiation-Won-Lost) and funnel stage also automatically change(Lead-MQL-PQL-SQL-Customer).

I used ChatGpt for creating a professional summary template which helps me to make a professional summary or report for Part 4.

         Here is Prompt:- Give me a professional and sort summary template which will help me to 
                                    Make a summary for my assignment .

 I used AI(Chatgpt and Bard) when I was stuck in the project to understand what I have to do next .
